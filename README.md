# Fibonacci

This is a repository for dev practicing!

## Using
- Clone the repository to your local computer.
- This repositoty uses poetry for managing python dependencies. You could use it with Anaconda by running `conda create --name fibonacci python=3.10.12 poetry` (Not need if you have poetry installed on your computer).
- After navigating to the repository, run `poetry install`.

## Notes
- Do not modify branch main directly, create a work branch, test your work and then make a pull request to main.
- Please note that in the pyproject.toml file, there are two dev dependencies, pytest and flake8. Pytest is a framework for writting tests and Flake8 is a tool for code style checking.
- Make sure to create tests for your functions everytime possible (There are very simple examples in test_fibonacci.py).
- Run `pytest` and `flake8` before merging your code into main (You could do that on Anaconda Prompt if you are using Windows).
